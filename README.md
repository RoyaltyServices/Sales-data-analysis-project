# Sales-data-analysis-project
 
*In this project, I used Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib to evaluate and answer business questions concerning sales data from the previous 12 months. Hundreds of thousands of electronics shop transactions are split out by month, product kind, pricing, purchase address, and so on.*

**Methodology**
1. Data Cleaning: 
   - Dropped Nan values from the DataFrame, 
   - Changed Data types (to_datetime, to_numeric)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
   - What city has the highest number of sales?
   - What is the highest selling product? Why?
   - What time do we have peak sales so we can schedule adverts around this time?
3. Some Techniques used are:
   - Using pd.concat to join multiple csv files
   - Adding columns
   - Using groupby() to aggregate data
   - Plotting charts to visulaize data
   - Labelling graphs
4. Dashboard
   - Tableau Public was used to build a dashboard for the data
   - It is an interative visual that can be use to filter the data based on various parameters
